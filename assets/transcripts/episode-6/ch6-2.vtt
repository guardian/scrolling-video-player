I was a cherry grower in Young in the â€˜80s and decided to move to Orange for

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.080
all sorts of reasons.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.100
One of those was for love.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.405
Being a vineyard operator is very seasonal. So we have winter, where we prune

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:14.115
and get the vines ready for the next season.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:15.735
Then they come into bud burst.

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:18.825
You've got to nurture that crop, protect it from disease.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:22.425
Then by summer you're looking at, you've got the vines up and the fruit sitting

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.965
there, and then you come to the best time of the year, which is autumn and harvest.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:30.255
And then you reap what you get and you put it all away, and then you have a rest for

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:32.564
about a week, and then you start all over again.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:34.725
For Orange itself,

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:39.825
the effect of climate change is that what we did 20 years ago can't work today.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:42.675
So you have to adjust, and it's not just the wine industry.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.894
The apple industry is also having to do the same thing.

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:46.575
The cherries are having to do the same thing.

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:50.955
So agriculture itself is having to move and change because of the temperature.
