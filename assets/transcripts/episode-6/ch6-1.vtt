Ahh, Okay. Riesling.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.290
I watched David Attenborough the other day,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.550
and he said: don't be pessimistic.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.590
There’s still hope and there’s still a future.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.220
So I can see that agriculture still has hope and a future.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.530
It's just that in 20 years time,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.160
if you do want to be in agriculture and you do want to be in business, it is not

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.360
going to be like it is today.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.765
You really have to shift

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:26.485
how you think about all the resources that we use.

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:30.595
It's how we use the water, how we use the soil.

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:33.745
What's our effect on the species that are surrounding the farms?

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:38.935
All those things really need to become priorities in a farming system versus the

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:41.455
economics of: I just need a return on investment.

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:46.765
If we can shift those changes, agriculture has a major role to play going forward.
