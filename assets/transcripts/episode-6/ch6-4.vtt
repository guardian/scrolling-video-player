I have a really great memory of a guy called Bill Dowling out at Gumble.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.860
He was an 89-year-old farmer and the Gumble Creek ran past his farm.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.149
It was salty, the fish had died and there were no trees left on the banks of it.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.939
And he stood next to me in tears and said: I caused this. And I've got that memory

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.650
etched in my mind forever, and I will not stand next to someone when Iâ€™m 89

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.689
and say: I caused this.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.849
I want to be the person who stands there and says:

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.159
look at this, we improved it.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
Now it's not easy, and it hurts at times, because you do things that you know aren't

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.430
going to make any money, and it is nice to have, you know, some luxuries.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
But Pip and I want to be those people who can stand there and say: yep, we've

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720
left this in better condition than what we got it.
