We always have an argument about coal or solar or two degrees warmer or not,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.220
whether it's true science or no. There's a bigger story out there.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.149
And when you look at what agriculture is trying to do, we have to survive in

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.680
the environment as a business.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.060
We're not in an office block.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.620
We have to actually go out there and produce a product in a paddock under those conditions.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.050
So I think agriculture has changed significantly

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.560
over time. What I would say to people is: what have you done as an individual?

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.510
It's about everyone doing their bit.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.610
And I often get frustrated when I sit around a table with all my mates and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.720
we're having a few reds, particularly when I'm in Sydney, and they say: this is not

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.740
happening; that's not happening.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.760
I ask them: what have you done about buying a product that actually supports a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.780
change in the system?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.790
And they look at you and they blame a politician for something they can change themselves.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.245
And that's why agriculture is so exciting, because we have to change.

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:00.105
If you don't, you go broke.
