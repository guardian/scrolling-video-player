I have, personally, very limited experience of the issue of bushfire smoke.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.600
There are no snakes in Ireland.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.180
There's very little bushfire smoke in Ireland.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.860
So this is all pretty novel, from a medical perspective.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.100
When the smoke closed in

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:28.785
it was quite surreal. Initially, the people who were most affected were those of high susceptibility.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:30.965
And any man in the street

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:32.865
would be able to guess who they might be:

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.885
people who've got long-standing respiratory disease. People who've got very sensitive airways,

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:38.805
like the asthmatics.

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:45.835
And also there's a tendency for young kids and the elderly to also be susceptible.

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:48.975
We sort of saw a gradual drift.

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:51.885
There was an immediate effect where we saw quite a few of those people who were

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:56.055
affected and then a gradual increase in those who have less severe disease

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:57.465
presenting to our hospitals.
