So, this is a P2 mask.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.200
I'm just going to make sure that I put it the right way.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.340
You pull it back.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.450
Pull it down.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.320
Adjust it.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.360
Put it here.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.090
So, I have rheumatoid arthritis,

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:27.435
and other unspecified autoimmune conditions. And the smoke massively

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:31.425
increases my level of inflammation, which sets off other symptoms.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:36.585
What this has meant for me I guess over the last few weeks has been a lot of

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.254
brain fog, a lot of nausea, a lot of fatigue.

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:44.175
I would get incredibly sick. Iâ€™d be unable to eat, and throw up literally everything

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:44.985
that I took in.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.240
It was really hard to do everyday functions, such as make breakfast or

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.160
do laundry or things like that, which are obviously very, very necessary to my daily life.
