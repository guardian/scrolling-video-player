While we're collecting information on the respiratory and cardiovascular

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.820
consequences of this level of pollution, we're probably going to start picking up

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.240
signal from other types of diseases, which we didn't anticipate.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.450
And I suspect those sorts of chronic conditions may well be some of the ones

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.980
that we see some more information on.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.230
I think the one that always gets missed in this space is the emotional,

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:34.215
the psychological impact of this. There's definitely a change in people who

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.894
are affected by it. There’s an anxiety,

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:37.155
there's a nervousness,

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.725
there's an anger. But there's a change in mood,

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:46.004
and I don't know whether that's because of the concerns about what this is doing to people's health.

00:00:46.364 --> 00:00:49.935
You find in emergency medicine that one of the best things that you can do in

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:53.535
medicine is tell somebody what their disease is and where it's going to go.

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:57.195
And a lot of the time now, we're just like, you know:

00:00:58.035 --> 00:00:59.864
'We can't do much about this at the moment.

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:01.095
We don't know much about it –

00:01:01.214 --> 00:01:04.125
and as soon as we know something you'll hear about it'.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.755
This is not reassuring for a patient.
