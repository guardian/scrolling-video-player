First it was just unhealthy, and I remember when the air was 162 on the [Air Quality Index],

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.860
I was like, Oh god, I can't breathe in this.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.430
And then it got to 245. That was the first day that was “hazardous”.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.600
And it was really bad, like that

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.340
was when the smoke alarms were going off.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.060
But come January, we reached eight times hazardous levels.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.660
People said it reached 15 [times].

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.400
And when it got to that point, it seemed neverending.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.010
I think that's when we realised: this is a crisis,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.510
this isn't going anywhere.

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:29.595
And the sense of desolation 

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:34.905
that was there was profound, because I think we couldn’t see an end in sight,

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.635
we couldn’t see a way out.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:42.555
And the worst thing about any emergency or any bad situation I think is when you

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:43.935
don't see a way forward.

00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:47.775
There was nothing that people could do except hide away from the smoke, and there

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:51.345
were very, very few places to actually hide. Staying indoors –

00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:53.325
smoke was still getting in through the buildings.

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:55.275
Air purifiers, not strong enough.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.565
Everything was sold out.

00:00:56.805 --> 00:00:57.285
I think

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:03.615
there was a lot of hopelessness, a lot of panic in the people that I saw, 

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:07.395
and it was quite a struggle to not feel helpless in the situation.
