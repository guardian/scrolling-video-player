In this bay here was a massive kelp forest.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.170
We had beautiful sponge gardens down in deep water and some of the most vibrant

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.510
colours anywhere in the world. But the main attraction back in those days was

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.560
the giant kelp.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.910
There's only a few places in the world where you can dive in this massive forest.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.670
Unfortunately, the last of the forests, effective forests, on the east coast of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.680
Tasmania disappeared in the El Nino of the 2015-16 summer.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.019
Everybody knows about the coral bleaching of that era &mdash; those hot temperatures

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.010
affected here as well.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.830
So by end of March, going into April, of 2016, there was nothing left.
