I'm 65 as of a month ago.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.520
I've now got two little grandchildren.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.590
And what really, you know, doesn't upset me but disturbs me is I cannot, now, I

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.150
will not be able to show them what I saw.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:16.800
It's as simple as that.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.760
Going back 30 years ago, if I wanted a crayfish, okay, you get a licence and go

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.760
and catch your three, four, five crays within a dive.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.380
Can't do that anymore.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.130
I can't do that here.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.820
Nowhere.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.450
So

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:33.795
the effect on my psyche is, yeah, it's very, very sort of distressing.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.475
It disturbs me because the quality of the ocean has definitely changed.

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:39.435
There's no doubt about that.

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:45.254
And this is only in my lifetime, you know, I mean, if what's happening around

00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:47.565
elsewhere continues to go, I don't know what's going to happen.

00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:48.015
I really don't.

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:52.394
If the, if the climate change continues to affect this area to the same level within

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:53.295
the next generation.

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:56.800
Puh. Who knows.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.735
To get the environment to manage itself,

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:02.294
you've got to give it a break.
