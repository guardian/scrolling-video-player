If you imagine a three-dimensional forest, and you can actually literally fly through

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.910
the forest. Up through the surface canopy, midway, down through the bottom,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.960
looking up into the canopy.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.670
That's what it was like.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.270
It was a beautiful experience for anybody.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.770
These forests occupied massive areas of the east coast of [Tasmania].

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.100
In the, obviously, close in the coastal zone.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.960
So these little forests were effectively, from my way of thinking, little

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.950
natural nurseries.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.390
You couldn't put a net through them, you couldn't drive a boat through them because the surface

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.170
matting was so thick, but in under the forest, the fish life was, without doubt, far more

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.910
abundant than it is now.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.960
There's no doubt about that.
