Long spined sea urchins.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.490
These things eat everything. From an area that's absolutely rich with kelp and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.790
forest and down in

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.700
the deeper waters,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.930
it's like an asphalt driveway.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.830
There's nothing on it.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.410
There's no kelp.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.690
There's no periwinkles.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.650
There's no shellfish, there's no crabs, there's nothing.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.970
They spread their larvae.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.760
They breed in August, September, which is our coldest time.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.770
Going back 30, 40 years ago

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.630
it was just a degree, half a degree too cold for their larvae to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.020
survive.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.010
They hadn't made it down this far. But that one degree temperature change is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.100
enough to allow these animalsâ€™ larvae to survive.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.450
That's really what's driving it.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.110
They have predicted in another two to three years, over 30% of the east coast of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.680
Tasmania could very well be urchin barren.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.420
This is the cost, 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.129
this is the cost of climate change.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.890
Believe it or not. It's happened, right?
