I describe the emergency department as like Narnia. Itâ€™s forever winter, and Christmas 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.910
doesn't come.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.180
So we're always under intense pressure.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.040
Previously we used to think of winter as our really hard time in the emergency

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.330
department, but now with heat health emergencies, it is all year round.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.730
So summer is just as stressful.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.890
We know that since European settlement, more people have died of heat

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.770
health emergencies than all the rest of the combined natural disasters together.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.629
Heat is an insidious killer.

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.390
It's not a dramatic killer, and it's often the most vulnerable people in our society:

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.879
so the homeless, elderly people, young people, people with disabilities, they're

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.150
all more prone to be affected by heat health emergencies.
