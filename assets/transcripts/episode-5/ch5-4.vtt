Many people didn't realise the severity of the 2009 heatwave emergency across

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.310
south-eastern Australia.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.770
The severe spike in Victorian deaths has left Melbourne's morgue full.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.080
We have had an unprecedented demand upon our services.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.580
If you have neighbours, check on those neighbours, 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.070
make sure that they're okay.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.340
This is an extreme weather event that we've never experienced before.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.470
Around 450 across the whole of south-eastern Australia died during that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.570
three- and four-day period and in the emergency department, we had to institute

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.190
our disaster management process to manage the demand that occurred.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.420
We had stretchers on ambulances lined up with fans and cooling bottles 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.670
that we just literally had to go down and get from a hardware store. At one stage,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.520
a number of hospitals lost power and lost air-conditioning.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.840
We had so many people lined up to come into the emergency department that we

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.730
couldn't close the electronic doors.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.000
So our air-conditioning was ineffective. And I think a lot of that was under-recognised, both

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.880
by the general community and by policymakers.
