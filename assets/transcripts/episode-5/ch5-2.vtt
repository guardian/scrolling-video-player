That’s the lemongrass.

It's still got the smell. When my kids were babies

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.130
we used to go out hunting, swimming. Hot day, fine.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.530
Bush tucker. That was back in the ‘90s. And today you go out,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.990
you can't even stand the heat. And that's it there.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.870
In the ground, in the ground. 

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.695

Wupurarni people means Aboriginal people here in Warumungu.

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:38.685
That's how they survive with bush tucker, going out, getting bush tucker. Go out

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:42.285
hunting and doing all that stuff. But they can't do it anymore. Because it's too hot.

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:47.745

The animals are still, goanna mainly, they still hibernating because they can't 

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:50.754
tell the season now, you know, because of the hot. 

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:52.754
<v Melissa Rankine><b>Melissa Rankine</b>
And we know it’s called global warming,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.340
we know it's climate change, and that's what's happening around the world.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.160
And the bush plants and the bush tucker, they're all dying, and we can’t get them.
