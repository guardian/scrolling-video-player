Well, I’ve been talking to all the old people.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.980
What do you all reckon about this heat? They reckon it’s no good.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.210
It's different than the heat they had back in the station.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.785
They used to live in tin sheds all year round: winter, summer.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:20.885
You’d never burn. Today,

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:23.285
you go underneath a tin shed today, 

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:25.955
you'd be fried underneath. 

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:26.955
That’s how scorching it is.

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:29.825

We used to have fans.

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:33.215
We used to survive in the fan, but nowadays we can't.

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:34.835
We need air-conditioning.

00:00:34.894 --> 00:00:36.455
<v Norman Frank><b>Norman Frank</b>
We’re talking about climate change.

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.825
Our river’s dry, all our

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:41.015
trees are dry out there. The grass,

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:44.615
the land is so burnt, scorched too.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.144
You can't walk anymore.

00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:47.655
It's too hot.

00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:49.845
You'd be jumping from shade to shade.
