Part of the appeal for us for moving here, originally, was so that our children

00:06.580 --> 00:10.000 size:80% 
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
could be raised in an environment where they know what love is

00:10.400 --> 00:13.000 size:80% 
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
where they know what care is; where they know their responsibilities of

00:13.200 --> 00:15.200 size:80% 
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
caring for country as Aboriginal people.

Out here in the rural area where we’re living, it’s possible for us

00:19.900 --> 00:24.010 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
to teach our kids those values, without the outside influences of our people

00:24.500 --> 00:29.030 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
living in poverty due to systemic racism; our people living in harsh conditions

00:29.500 --> 00:31.240 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
with drugs and alcohol around them; the over-policing of our people.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.500 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
So our kids weren’t subjected to those outside influences

00:35.600 --> 00:40.220 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
and so that they can be raised in a way that was strong culturally, spiritually and ethically.

00:40.230 --> 00:43.190 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
They’re aware of all that stuff that’s happening with our people

00:44.300 --> 00:46.170 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
but so that they’re not subjected to it, so that they can be strong for when

00:46.480 --> 00:48.170 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
it does come and meet them face to face.

00:48.180 --> 00:50.210 size:80%
<v Laurance Magick Dennis><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
So that they can stand and face it like we’ve had to.
