This is my beautiful husband, his name is Locky, I call him gulirr, 

00:04.020 --> 00:07.050 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
which means sweetheart in our language. 

00:07.100 --> 00:09.010 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
And yeah he’s the love of my life.

00:09.020 --> 00:13.000 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
I call her gulirr too, gulirr means life partner. 

00:13.050 --> 00:16.120 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Laurance Magick Dennis</b>
And she’s my beautiful wife and we’ve been married for over six years.

00:17.080 --> 00:21.100 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
We are cultural knowledge holders and cultural leaders for our people,

00:21.170 --> 00:26.220 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
so when we share things like language and song and dance and ceremony,

00:26.250 --> 00:29.080 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
it's about sharing that in a context,

00:29.081 --> 00:31.300 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
and all of that information is connected to country,

00:31.310  --> 00:33.220 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
which includes water. 

00:33.260 --> 00:38.110 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
So all the different water sources and, whether it's a billabong,

00:38.180 --> 00:43.300 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
which we call bilabang in our language, or whether it's a bila, a river, or a creek, dharran,

00:43.310 --> 00:48.200 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
all those different places are connected to our stories and our culture.

00:48.210 --> 00:53.170 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
And without country and without waterways, we can't have a culture.

00:53.240 --> 01:01.080 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
Our inability to take our kids down to the creek and show them how to gather the freshwater mussels, and how to cook them up on the fire.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.320 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
The inability to show our kids how to gather the edible roots.

01:04.330 --> 01:11.160 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
And what to eat and then how to make sure that we sustainably manage those resources.

01:11.180 --> 01:16.240 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
The inability to show our kids how to fish for the guya, the fish in the water. 

01:16.250 --> 01:20.210 size:80% 
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
And how to do things according to the local seasons.

01:20.890 --> 01:25.180 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
At the moment, nothing's really, like nothing's growing. Everything's dying.

01:25.580 --> 01:29.180 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
And the simple act of a father showing his son how to fish, which is a 

01:29.700 --> 01:33.310 size:80%
<v Locky and Fleur><b>Fleur Magick Dennis</b>
very strong cultural thing in our culture. That can't happen anymore.
